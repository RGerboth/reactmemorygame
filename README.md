# React Memory Game
A simple memory game using React

## Overview
This is my first React-based application. The game challenges the player to click on each image only once, scoring a point for each correct choice and keeping track of the high score. I already had an array of 1990's Nickelodeon cartoon characters (and one Looney Toon) so that's what you see. Not much styling at all on the display.
